Syntax Parsers:
 A program that reads your code and determines if its grammar (or syntax) is valid

Execution Contexts:
 A wrapper to help manage the code that is running

 - Base is the Global Execution Context (there can be a few contexts run

 - Creates a Global Object (means not inside a function) and 'this.' 

 - In the browser, the Global Object = the Window = 'this.' 

 - Inside Execution Context also exists Outer Environment (which is null at Global level, because nothing exists outside it), and Code.

Lexical Environments:
 Where something sits physically in the code you write.


Name/Value Paris & Objects:
 Can only have one value in any given context, but a name can have more value/pairs.

Object: 
 Collection of Name/Value Pairs (like JSON (says me))
