ES6 and Classes

Be careful. Classes aren't objects in other languages, but they are in JS, and you create new objects from that object

class Person {
	
	constructor(firstname, lastname) {
		this.firstname = firstname;
		this.lastname = lastname;
	}

	greet() {
		return 'Hi ' + firstname + ' ' + lastname;
	}
}

var john = new Person('JOhn', 'Doe');


// To set the Prototype:
// use EXTENDS (sets the prototype) and SUPER:

class InformalPerson extends Person {
	
	constructor(firstname, lastname) {
		super(firstname, lastname);
	}
}

A different way to TYPE something that doesn't change how it works under the hood
