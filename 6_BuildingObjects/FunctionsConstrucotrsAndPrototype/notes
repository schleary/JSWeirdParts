Function Constructors and '.prototype'

Any time you create a function object, it comes with



Function - a special type of object. Has:

 - Name (optional, can be anonymous)
 - Code (invokable)
 - Prototype (used only by 'new' operator)
   - of object created, not of the function itself



Danger: 'new' and functions:

If you forget the 'new' keyword, it still executes the function 
and if you aren't returning anything, it'll return undefined, 
which can cause an error

When you intend a function to be a function constructor, 
name the function with a capital letter. 
This can remind you to use 'new

BUT, function constructors will probably disappear soon.
