By Value, By Reference

Primitive Value (by value)
 a = 3
 setting a references a memory location

 b = a

 copy of primitive value in another space in memory


Object (by reference)
 a = 3

 b = a (or pass to a function)

Both a and b point to the same location in memory

ALL OBJECTS ACT BY REFERENCE


Mutate - to be changed
Immutable - can't be changed
