Objects, Functions, and 'this'

When a function is invoked, a new execution context is created (CREATION PHASE)

Each execution has:
 - Variable Environment
 - Outer Environment (all the way to global)
 - 'this' (points at different things depend on:
 		where the function is
 		how the funciton is invoked
 		)
